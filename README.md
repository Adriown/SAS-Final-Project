# SAS-Final-Project
Work in the SAS class was condensed into a final group project that was presented. Our ultimate work for that can be found here.

We were provided data on the work hours logged by three separate consultants and tasked with taking different cuts of the data, as well as compiling what was originally four spreadsheets into one master spreadsheet.

Then we had an open-ended portion of the project which was to produce information from the data using ideas that we came up with (this is Section 4).

For our open-ended work, we decided to pursue an analysis of the consultants' efficiency (hours of work per day).
